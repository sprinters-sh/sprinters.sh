{% include h2.html text="1. Definitions, validity" %}

{% include h2.html text="2. Service specification" %}
2.1. Sprinters offers users the possibility to launch GitHub Actions jobs on virtual machines running on the customer's own cloud accounts. These virtual machines are not operated by InfrastructureX.

The user agrees that InfrastructureX may use these hosting platforms throughout the duration of the service agreement.

2.2. All features of Sprinters are explained, where necessary, in the respective places or on the Sprinters website. The user can continually use the features of the service that are included in the service package booked by the user.

3.1. If the user wishes to use Sprinters, he/she can create a customer account at https://console.sprinters.sh. The user can register on the Sprinters website using their existing GitHub account. After confirming that he/she accepts the terms and the data collection and processing by the Sprinters website, installing the “sprinters.sh” GitHub app constitutes a binding offer to InfrastructureX to finalize a service agreement. The offer does not constitute a conclusion of a contract. Following InfrastructureX’s receipt of the offer, the user is verified with the authentication service and the account is activated. In activating the user account, acceptance of the user’s offer to conclude a contract is confirmed. Setting up a customer account is free of charge to the user.

5.3. The contract can be cancelled by InfrastructureX after expiry of the user's currently booked service packages with a notice period of 3 months.

5.4. InfrastructureX may cancel the contract with immediate effect if the user withdraws the privacy policy enabling InfrastructureX to use their personal data.
