{% include h2.html text="TL;DR" %}
We treat your data like we would like ours to be treated. We only store the strict minimum set of information required to operate Sprinters. Personal and sensitive data is always encrypted. No trackers. No telemetry.

{% include h2.html text="1. General" %}
This privacy policy and the consent described in it applies to all features of the services offered by InfrastructureX GmbH at sprinters.sh (hereinafter referred to as “Sprinters”).

**You hereby expressly consent to the collection, processing and use of your personal data to the extent described in this privacy policy.**

{% include h2.html text="2. Collected data when using the website" %}
You may visit our website without entering personal details. We only store credentials that have no personal reference, such as the IP address, the name of your internet service provider, the web page from which you visit us or the name of a requested file. This data is only evaluated to help improve our offer, and it does not allow us to determine your identity. Personal data is only collected to the extent described in this privacy policy or if you voluntarily provide it to us when creating a user account, at a later stage when managing your user account, in connection with using Sprinters, or if you expressly consent to this data being collected.

{% include h2.html text="3. Collected data in connection with a user account" %}
We create a new Sprinters user account for you when you log in to Sprinters for the first time with your GitHub account. We always store collected personal data in encrypted form, using encryption with AES-256 or a similarly secure algorithm. The key is never stored in the database. The data can only be encrypted and decrypted by Sprinters.

{% include h3.html text="3.1. Data collection during initial login" %}
When creating your account, we store the data that is transmitted and provided by GitHub, which is required for you to be able to log in to Sprinters in the future. In order to create an account with Sprinters, you must also accept our terms and this privacy policy. We record the date and time of your acceptance.

{% include h3.html text="3.2. Data collection when GitHub Actions jobs" %}
To run GitHub Actions jobs on virtual machines (referred to as “instances”) on a hosting or cloud service provider (“service provider”) that is supported by us, you will need to provide us with the relevant credentials for an account you own at that service provider. You can enter these yourself in the settings section of your Sprinters account on the Sprinters website. We store and use these credentials in order to access your account with your service provider and to launch, enumerate and terminate the instances there. We also record the identifier and the placement details (region, VPC, ...) of each instance launched as well the time it took to launch the instance and the duration for which it ran.
