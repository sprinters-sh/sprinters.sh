# Privacy Policy
for Sprinters (as of 2024-06-27)

## TL;DR
We treat your data like we would like ours to be treated. Only the strict  minimum amount of information required to operate Sprinters is stored. Personal and sensitive data is always encrypted. No trackers. No telemetry.

## 1. General
This privacy policy and the consent described in it applies to all features of the services offered by InfrastructureX GmbH at sprinters.sh (hereinafter referred to as “Sprinters”).

**You hereby expressly consent to the collection, processing and use of your personal data to the extent described in this privacy policy.**

## 2. Collected data when using the website
You may visit our website without entering personal details. We only store credentials that have no personal reference, such as the IP address, and therefore the name of your internet service provider, the web page from which you visit us or the name of a requested file. This data is only evaluated to help improve our offer and it does not allow us to determine your identity. Personal data is only collected to the extent described in this privacy policy or if you voluntarily provide it to us when creating a user account, at a later stage when managing your user account, in connection with using Sprinters, or if you expressly consent to this data being collected.

## 3. Collected data in connection with a user account
A new user account is created using an existing user account with a service that is intended for use on multiple websites and for registration with multiple services, such as a GitHub account (“authentication service”). We always store collected personal data in encrypted form, using encryption with AES-256 or a similarly secure algorithm. The key is never stored in the database. The data can only be encrypted and decrypted by Sprinters.

### 3.1. Data collection during initial log-in
When you log in for the first time, we store the data that is transmitted and provided by the authentication service, which is required when a user logs in to Sprinters in the future. If you agree to our terms and this privacy policy when registering, we will also record the time of your acceptance in your user account, which is also created at this moment.

### 3.2. Data collection for the running of GitHub Actions jobs
To run GitHub Actions jobs on virtual machines (referred to as “instances”) on a hosting or cloud service provider (“service provider”) that is supported by us, you will need to provide us with the relevant credentials. You can enter these yourself in the administrative section of your Sprinters account on the Sprinters website. We store and use the data in order to access your account with your service provider and to transfer, execute and manage the instances there.

### 3.3. Data collection when updating or entering a billing address
When entering your billing address, we store your company name, company address, your EU Reverse Charge VAT ID and the EU Reverse Charge VAT ID validation, if applicable.

### 3.4. Data collection for a credit card saved as means of payment
If you enter your credit card details as means of payment, we store the last four digits of the credit card number, the owner as stated on the credit card, as well as the month and year that the credit card expires. The complete credit card details are saved in PCI compliant form by the company [Paddle](https://paddle.com), who process payment transactions on our behalf.

## 4. Data collected when deploying instances
For each case of deploying a new instance with a service provider, the application is first registered with the service provider according to the service provider’s mechanisms. The data provided by the service provider that is required for operating and monitoring the instance is stored by Sprinters to enable it to provide the services offered.

## 5. Objection
You may object to the use of your data at any time with future effect by contacting us using the details below. Please note that Sprinters only collects, stores and processes the data that is necessary for operating the service. If you object to the use of your data, use of the service will be restricted or not at all possible.

## 6. Use of cookies
When the user’s web browser communicates with Sprinters, an encrypted cookie is sent to determine the identity of the user. This cookie is also stored locally on the user’s computer in encrypted form. Likewise, the browser also automatically sends a user agent header by default. The browser automatically sends this header as soon as a connection has been established. This is not specific to Sprinters. This header contains various information which is transmitted to us by your browser, such as the type and version of the operating system or the type and version of the browser.

## 7. Right to information
Under the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz), you have a right to obtain information regarding your stored data free of charge, as well as a right to amend, block or delete this data.

## 8. Contact details for questions relating to our privacy policy
For any questions regarding the collection, processing or use of your personal data, as well as to request information on, to amend, block or delete data and to withdraw granted consent, please contact: InfrastructureX GmbH, Baubergerstr. 59, 80992 München, Germany
