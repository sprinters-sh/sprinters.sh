By default, Sprinters sends email notifications to all team members of an organization that have previously logged in
to the [Sprinters Console](https://console.sprinters.sh).

There are two types of notifications:
{: .mb-1 }
- Configuration errors (AWS account configuration errors, runs-on: label syntax errors, ...)
- Billing alerts (Credits expired, credits running out, ...)

{% include h2.html text="Adjusting preferences" %}

You can individually select which of your organizations' notifications you want to receive
in your organizations' settings in the Sprinters Console:

These are personal settings. Changing them will not affect which notifications are received
by other members of your organization.
